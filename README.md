Map Bookmarks iOS app 
=============================================================

iOS application for managing bookmarks of your favorite locations on a map. You can bookmark a location/address by a long tap on any spot of the main map screen you like. All bookmarks are saved in the local database. It is also possible to build a route from your current location to the selected bookmark.

Clicking on a bookmark's callout opens a new screen where you can rename your bookmakrs with the help of nearby places list (which is downloaded from Foursquare Venues servers).

**Note:** This project is compatible with iOS 9.1 and Xcode 7.1.1.  
**Note:** Please, replace client_id and client_secret with your own for connecting to Foursquare servers. They are here for testing purpose **only**.
